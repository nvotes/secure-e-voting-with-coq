This folder verifies transcripts generated by the braid mixnet. Lib.ml is identical to the one present in the Verificatum subfolder, except for prime values p, q.

Compile with:

    make

Run with default (data/transcript_braid.json) data:

    make run

Use

./a.out <transcript.json>

to run with a user supplied json transcript file.

To generate transcript data in braid run

    cargo test gen_coq_data

from the braid root. Then copy the generated file, for example

    cp transcript_braid.json ../secure-e-voting-with-coq/OCamlBraid/data

The p and q parameters have to be manually specified in lib.ml, main.ml will check for a mismatch and warn you.
